This module allows creation of mailto-link using obfuscated eMail-addresses.

The provided eMail-Address will be obfuscated by simply reversing it. Using CSS
the eMail-address will be perfectly readable in the default HTML-output but 
robots greping the site will simply see a 'reversed' eMail-address or some 
garbage.

By clicking on the link the reversed eMail-address will be send to a proxy that
simply redirects the browser to a mailto-url containing the corret eMail-address

USage:
------

1. In your application.conf-file add the Module to the list of modules
2. In your view-script you can then add the following code snippet to create a
mailto link to the address info@example.com:

::

    <?php echo $this->mailto('info@example.com');

The second parameter is optional and its content will be set as link-name (The
stuff between the <a> and </a>)

The third parameter can be an associative array with further attributes for 
the anchor-tag. Setting a specific class can be achieved via the following 
array: {{ array('class'=> 'MyClassName')); }}
If you want to set the third parameter but omit the second, pass '{{null}}' as 
second parameter.
